  <p o="145" eid="841"><span class="sc" o="145" eid="842">the function of the masticatory</span> system is complex. Discriminatory contraction of the various head and neck muscles is necessary to move the mandible precisely and allow effective functioning. A highly refined neurologic control system regulates and coordinates the activities of the entire masticatory system. It consists primarily of nerves and muscles; hence the term <i o="515" eid="843">neuromuscular system</i>. A basic grasp of the anatomy and function of the neuromuscular system is essential to an understanding of the influence that tooth contacts as well as other conditions have on mandibular movement.</p>
  <p o="733" eid="844">This chapter is divided into three sections. The first reviews in detail the basic neuroanatomy and function of the neuromuscular system. The second describes the basic physiologic activities of mastication, swallowing, and speech. The third reviews important concepts and mechanisms that are necessary to understand orofacial pain. A grasp of the concepts outlined in these three sections will greatly enhance the clinician's ability to understand a patient's complaint and provide effective therapy.</p>

    <h2 class="title" o="1234" eid="846">Anatomy and Function of the Neuromuscular System</h2>
    <p o="1282" eid="847">For purposes of discussion, the neuromuscular system is divided into its two major components: the neurologic structures and the muscles. The anatomy and function of each of these components is reviewed separately, although in many instances it is difficult to distinguish them. With an understanding of these components, basic neuromuscular function can be reviewed.</p>

      <div class="level" o="1670" eid="850">
        <h2 class="title" o="1670" eid="851">The neuron</h2>
        <p o="1680" eid="852">The basic structural unit of the nervous system is the neuron. It is composed of a mass of protoplasm termed the <i o="1793" eid="853">nerve cell body</i> and protoplasmic processes from the nerve cell body called <i o="1868" eid="854">dendrites</i> and <i o="1882" eid="855">axons</i>. The nerve cell bodies located in the spinal cord are found in the gray substance of the central nervous system (CNS). Cell bodies found outside the CNS are grouped together in <i o="2065" eid="856">ganglia</i>. The axon (from the Greek word <i o="2104" eid="857">axon</i>, meaning “axle” or “axis”) is the central core that forms the essential conducting part of a neuron and is an extension of cytoplasm from a nerve cell. Many neurons are grouped together to form a nerve fiber. These neurons are capable of transferring electrical and chemical impulses along their axes, thus enabling information to pass both in and out of the CNS. Depending on their location and function, neurons are designated by different terms. An <i o="2561" eid="858">afferent</i> neuron conducts the nervous impulse toward the CNS, whereas an <i o="2633" eid="859">efferent</i> neuron conducts it peripherally. <i o="2675" eid="860">Internuncial neurons</i>, or <i o="2700" eid="861">interneurons</i>, lie wholly within the CNS. The first sensory neuron is called the <i o="2780" eid="862">primary</i> or <i o="2791" eid="863">first-order neuron</i>. <i o="2811" eid="864">Second</i>- and <i o="2823" eid="865">third-order</i> sensory neurons are interneurons. <i o="2869" eid="866">Motor</i> or efferent neurons convey nervous impulses to produce muscular or secretory effects.</p>
        <p o="2960" eid="867">Nerve impulses are transmitted from one neuron to another only at a synaptic junction, or <i o="3050" eid="868">synapse</i>, where the processes of two neurons are in close proximity. All afferent synapses are located within the gray substance of the CNS; normally, therefore, there are no anatomic peripheral connections between sensory fibers. All connections are within the CNS, and the peripheral transmission of a sensory impulse from one fiber to another is abnormal.</p>

      <div class="level" o="3407" eid="869">
        <h2 class="title" o="3407" eid="870">The sensory receptors</h2>
        <p o="3428" eid="871">Sensory receptors are neurologic structures or organs located in all body tissues that provide information to the CNS by way of the afferent neurons regarding the status of these tissues. As in other areas of the body, various types of sensory receptors are located throughout the tissues that make up the masticatory system. Specialized sensory receptors provide specific information to the afferent neurons and thus back to the CNS.</p>
        <p o="3862" eid="872">Sensory receptors found in the peripheral tissues such as the skin and oral mucosa are called <i o="3956" eid="873">exteroceptors</i>. These receptors provide information from the exterior tissues of the body informing the CNS of the conditions in the environment. There are specialized exteroceptors to depict heat, cold, light touch, and pressure. There are also receptors that are specific for discomfort and pain. These are called <i o="4271" eid="874">nociceptors</i>. Nociceptors are located not only in the peripheral tissues, but also throughout the body.</p>
        <p o="4373" eid="875">Other receptors provide information regarding the position and movement of the mandible and associated oral structures. These are called <i o="4510" eid="876">proprioceptors</i> and are primarily found in all the musculoskeletal structures. Receptors that carry information regarding the status of the internal organs are referred to as <i o="4684" eid="877">interoceptors</i>. Interoceptors inform the CNS of the status of internal structures and processes such as blood flow, digestion, and breathing. Constant input received from all of these receptors allows the cortex and brainstem to coordinate the action of individual muscles or muscle groups so as to create an appropriate response.</p>
        <p o="5013" eid="878">Information from the tissues outside the CNS must be transferred into the CNS and onto the higher centers in the brainstem and cortex for interpretation and evaluation. Once this information is evaluated, appropriate action must be taken. The higher centers then send impulses down the spinal cord and back out to the periphery to an efferent organ for the desired action. The primary afferent neuron (first-order neuron) receives a stimulus from the sensory receptor. This impulse is carried by the primary afferent neuron into the CNS by way of the dorsal root to synapse in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord with a secondary (second-order) neuron (<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_f0010" o="5665" eid="879">Figure 2-1</a>).

Note that the first-order neurons (primary afferents) carry input into the dorsal horn to synapse with the second-order neurons. The second-order neuron then crosses over and ascends on to the higher centers. Small interneurons connect the primary afferent neuron with the primary motor (efferent) neuron, allowing reflex arc activity. The dorsal root ganglion (DRG) contains the cell bodies of the primary afferent neurons.</h2><img "400" "212" class="graphic" id="978-0-323-08220-4_0032" src="./Chapter_2/978-0-323-08220-4_0032.jpg" o="6213" eid="883"><div class="caption" o="6213" eid="884">(Adapted from Okeson JP: <i o="6238" eid="885">Bell's Orofacial Pains</i>. 5th ed.

The impulse is then carried by the second-order neuron across the spinal cord to the anterolateral spinothalamic pathway, which ascends to the higher centers. There may be multiple <i o="6549" eid="886">interneurons</i> (third-order, fourth-order, etc.) involved with the transfer of this impulse to the thalamus and cortex. There are also interneurons located in the dorsal horn that may become involved with the impulse as it synapses with the second-order neuron. Some of these neurons may synapse directly with an efferent neuron that is directed back out of the CNS by way of the ventral root to stimulate an efferent organ, such as a muscle.<p></p>

        <h2 class="title" o="6989" eid="888">The brainstem and brain</h2>
        <p o="7012" eid="889">Once nerve impulses have been passed to the second-order neurons, these neurons carry them to the higher centers for interpretation and evaluation. There are numerous centers in the brainstem and brain that help give meaning to these impulses. It should also be remembered that numerous interneurons may be involved in transmitting the impulses on to higher centers. In fact, attempting to follow an impulse through the brainstem on to the cortex is no simple task. In order to intelligently discuss muscle function and pain in this text, certain functional regions of the brainstem and brain must be described. The following description merely overviews a few of the important functional components of the CNS; other texts may be consulted for a more complete review.<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib1" o="7780" eid="890"><sup o="7780" eid="891">1</sup></a><sup o="7781" eid="892">,</sup><a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib2" o="7782" eid="893"><sup o="7782" eid="894">2</sup></a></p>

An understanding of these areas and their functions is most helpful in appreciating orofacial pain. The important areas reviewed below are the spinal tract nucleus, the reticular formation, the thalamus, the hypothalamus, the limbic structures and the cortex. They are discussed in the order by which neural impulses pass on to the higher centers.</p>
        <div class="level" o="8241" eid="897">
          <h2 class="title" o="8241" eid="898">The spinal tract nucleus</h2>
          <p o="8265" eid="899">Throughout the body, primary afferent neurons synapse with the second-order neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal column. Afferent input from the face and oral structures, however, does not enter the spinal cord by way of spinal nerves. Instead, sensory input from the face and mouth is carried by way of the fifth cranial nerve, the trigeminal nerve. The cell bodies of the trigeminal afferent neurons are located in the large gasserian ganglion. Impulses carried by the trigeminal nerve enter directly into the brainstem in the region of the pons to synapse in the trigeminal spinal nucleus (<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_f0015" o="8862" eid="900">Figure 2-2</a>). This region of the brainstem is structurally very similar to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. In fact, it may be considered an extension of the dorsal horn and is sometimes referred to as the medullary dorsal horn.</p>
          <p o="9092" eid="901">The trigeminal complex of the brainstem consists of (1) the main sensory trigeminal nucleus, which is rostrally located and receives periodontal and some pulpal afferents, and (2) the spinal tract of the trigeminal nucleus, which is more caudally located. The spinal tract is divided into (1) the subnucleus oralis, (2) the subnucleus interpolaris, and (3) the subnucleus caudalis, which corresponds to the medullary dorsal horn. Tooth pulp afferents go to all three subnuclei.<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib3" o="9569" eid="902"><sup o="9569" eid="903">3</sup></a> The subnucleus caudalis has especially been implicated in trigeminal nociceptive mechanisms on the basis of electrophysiologic observations of nociceptive neurons.<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib4" o="9734" eid="904"><sup o="9734" eid="905">4</sup></a><sup o="9735" eid="906">,</sup><a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib5" o="9736" eid="907"><sup o="9736" eid="908">5</sup></a> The subnucleus oralis appears to be a significant area of this trigeminal brainstem complex for oral pain mechanisms.<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib5" o="9855" eid="909"><sup o="9855" eid="910">5</sup></a>-<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib7" o="9857" eid="911"><sup o="9857" eid="912">7</sup></a></p>

        <div class="level" o="11750" eid="927">
          <h2 class="title" o="11750" eid="928">The thalamus</h2>
          <p o="11762" eid="929">The thalamus is located in the very center of the brain, with the cerebrum surrounding it from the top and sides and the midbrain below (<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_f0015" o="11899" eid="930">Figure 2-2</a>). It is made up of numerous nuclei that function together to interrupt impulses. Almost all impulses from the lower regions of the brain as well as from the spinal cord are relayed through synapses in the thalamus before proceeding to the cerebral cortex. The thalamus acts as a relay station for most of the communication between the brainstem, cerebellum, and cerebrum. As impulses arise to the thalamus, the thalamus makes assessments and directs the impulses to appropriate regions in the higher centers for interpretation and response.</p>
          <p o="12450" eid="931">If one were to compare the human brain to a computer, the thalamus would represent the keyboard, which controls the functions and directs the signals. The thalamus drives the cortex to activity and enables the cortex to communicate with the other regions of the CNS. Without the thalamus, the cortex is useless.</p>

        <div class="level" o="12761" eid="932">
          <h2 class="title" o="12761" eid="933">The hypothalamus</h2>
          <p o="12777" eid="934">The hypothalamus is a small structure in the middle of the base of the brain. Although it is small, its function is great. The hypothalamus is the major center of the brain for controlling internal body functions, such as body temperature, hunger, and thirst. Stimulation of the hypothalamus excites the sympathetic nervous system throughout the body, increasing the overall level of activity of many internal parts of the body, especially increasing heart rate and causing blood vessel constriction. One can clearly see that this small area of the brain has some powerful effects on overall function. As discussed later, an increased level of emotional stress can stimulate the hypothalamus to upregulate the sympathetic nervous system and greatly influence nociceptive impulses entering the brain. This simple statement should have extreme meaning to the clinician managing pain.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="level" o="13658" eid="935">
          <h2 class="title" o="13658" eid="936">The limbic structures</h2>
          <p o="13679" eid="937">The word <i o="13688" eid="938">limbic</i> means “border.” The limbic system comprises the border structures of the cerebrum and the diencephalon. The limbic structures function to control our emotional and behavioral activities. Within the limbic structures are nuclei or centers responsible for specific behaviors such as anger, rage, and docility. The limbic structures also control emotions such as depression, anxiety, fear, and paranoia. There also appears to be a pain/pleasure center that on an instinctive level drives the individual toward behaviors that stimulate the pleasure side of the center and away from pain. These drives are not generally perceived on a conscious level but more as a basic instinct. The instinct, however, will bring certain behaviors to consciousness. For example, when an individual experiences chronic pain, his or her behavior will be oriented toward withdrawal from any stimulus that might increase the pain. Often the sufferer will withdraw from life and mood changes such as depression will appear. It is believed that portions of the limbic structures interact and develop associations with the cortex, thereby coordinating the conscious cerebral behavioral functions with the subconscious behavioral functions of the deeper limbic system.</p>
          <p o="14935" eid="939">Impulses from the limbic system leading into the hypothalamus can modify any one or all of the many internal bodily functions controlled by the hypothalamus. Impulses from the limbic system feeding into the midbrain and medulla can control such behavior as wakefulness, sleep, excitement, and attentiveness. With this basic understanding of limbic function one can quickly understand the impact it can have on overall function. The limbic system certainly plays an essential role in pain problems, as discussed in later chapters.</p>

        <div class="level" o="15464" eid="940">
          <h2 class="title" o="15464" eid="941">The cortex</h2>
          <p o="15474" eid="942">The cerebral cortex, made up predominantly of gray matter, is the outer region of the cerebrum. It is the portion of the brain most frequently associated with the thinking process—even though it cannot provide thinking without the simultaneous action of deeper structures of the brain—and it is here that essentially all of our memories are stored. This is also the area most responsible for our ability to acquire our many muscle skills. We still do not know the basic physiologic mechanisms by which the cerebral cortex stores either memories or knowledge of muscle skills.</p>
          <p o="16049" eid="943">Through most of its extent, the cerebral cortex is about 6 mm thick, and it contains an estimated 50 billion to 80 billion nerve cell bodies in all. Perhaps a billion nerve fibers lead away from the cortex and a comparable number lead into it. These nerve fibers pass to other areas of the cortex, to and from deeper structures of the brain, and in some instances all the way to the spinal cord.</p>
          <p o="16444" eid="944">Different regions of the cerebral cortex have been identified to have different functions. There is a motor area, which is primarily involved with coordinating motor function. There is a sensory area, which receives somatosensory input for evaluation. There are also areas for special senses, such as the visual and auditory areas.</p>
          <p o="16775" eid="945">If we were to again compare the human brain with a computer, the cerebral cortex would represent the hard disc drive that stores all information of memory and motor function. Once again, it is important to remember that the thalamus (the keyboard) is the necessary unit that prompts the cortex to function.</p>

      <div class="level" o="17092" eid="948">
        <h2 class="title" o="17092" eid="949">The motor unit</h2>
        <p o="17106" eid="950">The basic component of the neuromuscular system is the motor unit, which consists of a number of muscle fibers innervated by one motor neuron. Each neuron joins with the muscle fiber at a motor endplate. When the neuron is activated, the motor endplate is stimulated to release small amounts of acetylcholine, which initiates depolarization of the muscle fibers (<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_f0020" o="17469" eid="951">Figure 2-3</a>). Depolarization causes the muscle fibers to shorten or contract.</p>
        <p o="17545" eid="952">The number of muscle fibers innervated by one motor neuron varies greatly according to the function of the motor unit. The fewer the muscle fibers per motor neuron, the more precise the movement. A single motor neuron may innervate only two or three muscle fibers, as in the ciliary muscles (which precisely control the lens of the eye). Conversely, one motor neuron may innervate hundreds of muscle fibers as in any large muscle (e.g., the rectus femoris in the leg). There is a similar variation in the number of muscle fibers per motor neuron within the muscles of mastication. The inferior lateral pterygoid muscle has a relatively low muscle fiber–motor neuron ratio and therefore is capable of the fine adjustments in length needed to adapt to horizontal changes in the mandibular position. In contrast, the masseter has a greater number of motor fibers per motor neuron, which corresponds to its more gross functions of providing the force necessary during mastication.</p>

        <p o="18531" eid="955">Hundreds to thousands of motor units, along with blood vessels and nerves, are bundled together by connective tissue and fascia to make up a muscle. The major muscles that control movement of the masticatory system were described in <a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B9780323082204000018_c0001" o="18764" eid="956">Chapter 1</a>. To understand the effect these muscles have on each other and their bony attachments, the basic skeletal relationships of the head and neck must be observed. The skull is supported in position by the cervical spine. It is not, however, centrally located or balanced over the cervical spine.

It can easily be seen that a balance of the skeletal components of the head and neck does not exist. Muscles are needed to overcome this imbalance of weight and mass. If the head is to be maintained in an upright position so it will be possible to see forward, muscles that attach the posterior aspect of the skull to the cervical spine and shoulder region must contract. Some of the muscles that serve this function are the trapezius, sternocleidomastoid, splenius capitis, and longus capitis. It is possible, however, for these muscles to overcontract and direct the line of vision too far upward. To counteract this, an antagonistic group of muscles exists in the anterior region of the head: the masseter (joining the mandible to the skull), the suprahyoids (joining the mandible to the hyoid bone), and the infrahyoids (joining the hyoid bone to the sternum and clavicle). When these muscles contract, the head is lowered. Thus there is a balance of muscular forces that maintains the head in the desired position (<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_f0025" o="20632" eid="961">Figure 2-4</a>). These muscles, plus others, also maintain proper side-to-side positioning and rotation of the head.<p></p>
        <div class="level" o="20744" eid="962">
          <h2 class="title" o="20744" eid="963">Muscle function</h2>
          <p o="20759" eid="964">The motor unit can carry out only one action: contraction or shortening. The entire muscle, however, has three potential functions: (1) When a large number of motor units in the muscle are stimulated, contraction or an overall shortening of the muscle occurs. This type of shortening under a constant load is called <i o="21075" eid="965">isotonic</i> contraction, which occurs in the masseter when the mandible is elevated, forcing the teeth through a bolus of food. (2) When a proper number of motor units contract in opposition to a given force, the resultant function of the muscle is to hold or stabilize the jaw. This contraction without shortening is called <i o="21397" eid="966">isometric</i> contraction, and it occurs in the masseter when an object is held between the teeth (e.g., a pipe or pencil). (3) A muscle also can function through <i o="21556" eid="967">controlled relaxation</i>. When stimulation of the motor unit is discontinued, the fibers of the motor unit relax and return to their normal length. By control of this decrease in motor unit stimulation, a precise muscle lengthening can occur that allows smooth and deliberate movement. This type of controlled relaxation is observed in the masseter when the mouth opens to accept a new bolus of food during mastication.</p>
          <p o="21972" eid="968">Using these three functions, the muscles of the head and neck maintain a constant desirable head position. A balance exists between the muscles that function to raise the head and those that function to depress it. During even the slightest movement of the head, each muscle functions in harmony with others to carry out the desired movement. If the head is turned to the right, certain muscles must shorten (isotonic contraction), others must relax (controlled relaxation), and still others must stabilize or hold certain relationships (isometric contraction). A highly sophisticated control system is needed to coordinate this finely tuned muscle balance.</p>
          <p o="22629" eid="969">These three types of muscle activities are present during the routine function of the head and neck. There is, however, another type of muscle activity called <i o="22788" eid="970">eccentric contraction,</i> which can occur during certain conditions. This type of contraction is often injurious to the muscle tissue. <i o="22920" eid="971">Eccentric contraction</i> refers to the forced lengthening of a muscle at the same time that it is contracting. An example of eccentric contraction occurs with the tissue damage associated during an extension-flexion injury (whiplash injury). At the precise moment of a motor vehicle accident, the cervical muscles contract to support the head and resist movement. If, however, the impact is great, the sudden change in the inertia of the head causes it to move while the muscles contract trying to support it. The result is a sudden lengthening of the muscles while they are contracting. This type of sudden lengthening while muscles are contracting often results in injury and is discussed in later sections devoted to muscle pain.</p>

        <div class="level" o="24618" eid="985">
          <h2 class="title" o="24618" eid="986">Muscle spindles</h2>
          <p o="24633" eid="987">Skeletal muscles consist of two types of muscle fibers. The first is extrafusal fiber, which is contractile and makes up the bulk of the muscle; the other is intrafusal fiber, which is only minutely contractile. A bundle of intrafusal muscle fibers bound by a connective tissue sheath is called a <i o="24930" eid="988">muscle spindle</i> (<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_f0030" o="24946" eid="989">Figure 2-5</a>). The muscle spindles primarily monitor tension within the skeletal muscles. They are interspersed throughout the muscles and aligned parallel with the extrafusal fibers. Within each spindle, the nuclei of the intrafusal fibers are arranged in two distinct fashions: chainlike (nuclear-chain type) and clumped (nuclear-bag type).</p>
          <p o="25286" eid="990">Two types of afferent nerves, classified according to their diameters, supply the intrafusal fibers. The larger fibers conduct impulses at a higher speed and have lower thresholds. Those that end in the central region of the intrafusal fibers are the larger group (Ia, A-alpha) (discussed later in this chapter) and are said to be the primary endings (so-called annulospiral endings). Those that end in the poles of the spindle (away from the central region) are the smaller group (II, A-beta) and are the secondary endings (so-called flower-spray endings).</p>
          <p o="25843" eid="991">The intrafusal fibers of the muscle spindles are aligned parallel to the extrafusal fibers of the muscles; therefore, as the muscle is stretched, so also are the intrafusal fibers. This stretch is monitored at the nuclear-chain and nuclear-bag regions. The annulospiral and flower-spray endings are activated by the stretch, and the afferent neurons carry these neural impulses to the CNS. The afferent neurons originating in the muscle spindles of the muscles of mastication have their cell bodies in the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus.</p>
          <p o="26382" eid="992">The intrafusal fibers receive efferent innervation by way of fusimotor nerve fibers. These fibers are given the alphabetical classification of gamma fibers or gamma efferents to distinguish them from the alpha nerve fibers, which supply the extrafusal fibers. Like other efferent fibers, the gamma efferent fibers originate in the CNS; when stimulated, they cause contraction of the intrafusal fibers. When the intrafusal fibers contract, the nuclear-chain and nuclear-bag areas are stretched, which is registered as if the entire muscle were stretched, and afferent activity is initiated. Thus there are two manners in which the afferent fibers of the muscle spindles can be stimulated: generalized stretching of the entire muscle (extrafusal fibers) and contraction of the intrafusal fibers by way of the gamma efferents. The muscle spindles can register only the stretch; they cannot differentiate between these two activities. Therefore the activities are recorded as the same activity by the CNS.</p>
          <p o="27383" eid="993">The extrafusal muscle fibers receive innervation by way of the alpha efferent motor neurons. Most of these have their cell bodies in the trigeminal motor nucleus. Stimulation of these neurons therefore causes the group of extrafusal muscle fibers (the motor unit) to contract.</p>
          <p o="27659" eid="994">From a functional standpoint, the muscle spindle acts as a length-monitoring system. It constantly feeds information regarding the state of elongation or contraction of the muscle back to the CNS. When a muscle is suddenly stretched, both its extrafusal and its intrafusal fibers elongate. The stretch of the spindle causes firing of the group I and II afferent nerve endings leading back to the CNS. When the alpha efferent motor neurons are stimulated, the extrafusal fibers of the muscle contract and the spindle is shortened. This shortening brings about a decrease in the afferent output of the spindle. If there were no gamma efferent system, a total shutdown of the spindle activity would occur during muscle contraction. As stated earlier, stimulation of the gamma efferents causes the intrafusal fibers of the muscle spindle to contract. This can elicit afferent activity from the spindle even when the muscle is contracting. Gamma efferent drive can therefore assist in maintaining muscle contraction.</p>
          <p o="28670" eid="995">It is believed that the gamma efferent system acts as a mechanism to sensitize the muscle spindles. Thus this fusimotor system acts as a biasing mechanism that alters the firing of the muscle spindle. It should be noted that the gamma efferent mechanism is not as well investigated in the masticatory system as in other spinal cord systems. Although it appears to be active in most of the masticatory muscles, some apparently have no gamma efferents. The importance of the gamma efferent system is further emphasized in the discussion of muscle reflexes.</p>

          <h2 class="title" o="29224" eid="997">Golgi tendon organs</h2>
          <p o="29243" eid="998">The Golgi tendon organs are located in the muscle tendon between the muscle fibers and their attachment to the bone. At one time they were thought to have a higher sensory threshold than the muscle spindles and therefore functioned solely to protect the muscle from excessive or damaging tension. It now appears that they are more sensitive and active in reflex regulation during normal function. They primarily monitor tension, whereas the muscle spindles primarily monitor muscle length.</p>
          <p o="29732" eid="999">The Golgi tendon organs occur in series with the extrafusal muscle fibers and not in parallel, as with the muscle spindles. Each of these sensory organs consists of tendinous fibers surrounded by lymph spaces enclosed within a fibrous capsule. Afferent fibers enter near the middle of the organ and spread out over the extent of the fibers. Tension on the tendon stimulates the receptors in the Golgi tendon organ. Therefore contraction of the muscle also stimulates the organ. Likewise, an overall stretching of the muscle creates tension in the tendon and again stimulates the organ.</p>

          <p o="30336" eid="1002">The pacinian corpuscles are large oval organs made up of concentric lamellae of connective tissue. These organs are widely distributed and, because of their frequent location in the joint structures, are considered to serve principally for the perception of movement and firm pressure (not light touch).</p>
          <p o="30639" eid="1003">At the center of each corpuscle is a core containing the termination of a nerve fiber. These corpuscles are found in the tendons, joints, periosteum, tendinous insertions, fascia, and subcutaneous tissue. Pressure applied to such tissues deforms the organ and stimulates the nerve fiber.</p>

          <h2 class="title" o="30926" eid="1005">Nociceptors</h2>
          <p o="30937" eid="1006">Generally, nociceptors are sensory receptors that are stimulated by injury and transmit injury information (nociception) to the CNS by way of the afferent nerve fibers. Nociceptors are located throughout most of the tissues in the masticatory system. Several general types exist: some respond exclusively to noxious mechanical and thermal stimuli; others respond to a wide range of stimuli, from tactile sensations to noxious injury; still others are low-threshold receptors specific for light touch, pressure, or facial hair movement. The last type is sometimes called a <i o="31509" eid="1007">mechanoreceptor</i>.</p>
          <p o="31525" eid="1008">The nociceptors (along with the proprioceptors) primarily function to monitor the condition, position, and movement of the tissues in the masticatory system. When conditions exist that are either potentially harmful or actually cause injury to the tissue, the nociceptors relay this information to the CNS as sensations of discomfort or pain. The sensation of pain is discussed later in this chapter.</p>

        <p o="31980" eid="1013">The dynamic balance of the head and neck muscles previously described is possible through feedback provided by the various sensory receptors. When a muscle is passively stretched, the spindles inform the CNS of this activity. Active muscle contraction is monitored by both the Golgi tendon organs and the muscle spindles. Movement of the joints and tendons stimulates the pacinian corpuscles. All of the sensory receptors are continuously providing input to the CNS. The brainstem and thalamus are in charge of constantly monitoring and regulating body activities. Information concerning normal body homeostasis is dealt with at this level and the cortex is not even brought into the regulatory process. If, however, incoming information has significant consequence to the person, the thalamus passes the information to the cortex for conscious evaluation and decision. The thalamus and brainstem therefore have a powerful influence on the individual's function.</p>

      <div class="level" o="32942" eid="1014">
        <h2 class="title" o="32942" eid="1015">Reflex action</h2>
        <p o="32955" eid="1016">A reflex action is the response resulting from a stimulus that passes as an impulse along an afferent neuron to a posterior nerve root or its cranial equivalent, from which it is then transmitted to an efferent neuron leading back to the skeletal muscle. Although the information is sent to the higher centers, the response is independent of will and occurs normally with no cortical or brainstem influence. A reflex action may be monosynaptic or polysynaptic. A monosynaptic reflex occurs when the afferent fiber directly stimulates the efferent fiber in the CNS. A polysynaptic reflex is present when the afferent neuron stimulates one or more interneurons in the CNS, which in turn stimulate the efferent nerve fibers.</p>
        <p o="33676" eid="1017">Two general reflex actions are important in the masticatory system: (1) the myotatic reflex and (2) the nociceptive reflex. These are not unique to the masticatory muscles but are found in other skeletal muscles as well.</p>
        <div class="level" o="33896" eid="1018">
          <h2 class="title" o="33896" eid="1019">Myotatic (stretch) reflex</h2>
          <p o="33921" eid="1020">The <i o="33925" eid="1021">myotatic,</i> or <i o="33938" eid="1022">stretch, reflex</i> is the only monosynaptic jaw reflex. When a skeletal muscle is quickly stretched, this protective reflex is elicited and brings about a contraction of the stretched muscle.</p>
          <p o="34126" eid="1023">A well-known example of the myotatic reflex is the patellar or knee-jerk reflex. When the patellar tendon is struck with a tendon hammer just below the patella, the quadriceps muscles in the thigh is stretched. This stimulates stretch sensory receptors (most importantly muscle spindles) that trigger an afferent impulse in a sensory nerve fiber of the femoral nerve, leading to the lumbar region (L4) of the spinal cord. There, the sensory neuron synapses directly with a motor neuron, which conducts an efferent impulse to the quadriceps femoris muscle, triggering contraction. This contraction, coordinated with the relaxation of the antagonistic flexor hamstring muscle, causes the leg to kick.</p>
          <p o="34824" eid="1024">The myotatic reflex can be demonstrated in the masticatory system by observing the masseter muscle as a sudden downward force is applied to the chin. This force can be applied with a small rubber hammer (<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_f0035" o="35028" eid="1025">Figure 2-6</a>). As the muscle spindles within the masseter suddenly stretch, afferent nerve activity is generated from the spindles. These afferent impulses pass into the brainstem to the trigeminal motor nucleus by way of the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus. These same afferent fibers synapse with the alpha efferent motor neurons, leading directly back to the extrafusal fibers of the masseter. Stimulation of the alpha efferent by the Ia afferent fibers causes the muscle to contract. Clinically, this reflex can be demonstrated by relaxing the jaw muscles, allowing the teeth to separate slightly. A sudden downward tap on the chin will cause the jaw to be reflexively elevated. The masseter then contracts, resulting in tooth contact.</p>
          <p o="35766" eid="1026">The myotatic reflex occurs without a specific response from the cortex and is very important in determining the resting position of the jaw. If there were complete relaxation of all the muscles that support the jaw, the forces of gravity would act to </p><div class="figure" o="36017" eid="1027"><h2 class="title" o="36017" eid="1028"><span class="label" o="36017" eid="1029">FIGURE 2-6 </span><b o="36028" eid="1030">A,</b> The myotatic reflex is activated by a sudden application of downward force to the chin with a small rubber hammer. This results in contraction of the elevator muscles (masseter), preventing further stretching and often causing elevation of the mandible into occlusion. <b o="36300" eid="1031">B,</b> The pathway is as follows: Sudden stretching of the muscle spindle increases the afferent output from the spindle. The afferent impulses pass into the brainstem by way of the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus. There the afferent fibers synapse in the trigeminal motor nucleus with the alpha efferent motor neurons, leading directly back to the extrafusal fibers of the elevator muscle, which was stretched. The reflex information sent to the extrafusal fibers is to contract. Note the presence of the gamma efferent fibers. Stimulation of these can cause contraction of the intrafusal fibers of the spindle and thus sensitize the spindle to a sudden stretch.</h2><img "363" "400" class="graphic" id="978-0-323-08220-4_0037" src="./Chapter_2/978-0-323-08220-4_0037.jpg" o="36961" eid="1032"></div> lower the jaw and separate the articular surfaces of the TMJ. To prevent this dislocation, the elevator muscles (and other muscles) are maintained in a mild state of contraction called <i o="37147" eid="1033">muscle tonus</i>. This property of the elevator muscles counteracts the effect of gravity on the mandible and maintains the articular surfaces of the joint in constant contact. The myotatic reflex is a principal determinant of muscle tonus in the elevator muscles. As gravity pulls down on the mandible, the elevator muscles are passively stretched, which also creates stretching of the muscle spindles. This information is reflexively passed from the afferent neurons originating in the spindles to the alpha motor neurons that lead back to the extrafusal fibers of the elevator muscles. Thus passive stretching causes a reactive contraction that relieves the stretch on the muscle spindle. Muscle tonus can also be influenced by afferent input from other sensory receptors, such as those from the skin or the oral mucosa.<p></p>
          <p o="37966" eid="1034">The myotatic reflex and resulting muscle tonus can also be influenced by the higher centers via the fusimotor system. The cortex and brainstem can bring increased gamma efferent activity to the intrafusal fibers of the spindle. As this activity increases, the intrafusal fibers contract, causing a partial stretching of the nuclear-bag and nuclear-chain areas of the spindles. This lessens the amount of stretch needed in the overall muscle before the spindle afferent activity is elicited. Therefore the higher centers can use the fusimotor system to alter the muscle spindles’ sensitivity to stretch. Increased gamma efferent activity increases the sensitivity of the myotatic (stretch) reflex, whereas decreased gamma efferent activity decreases the sensitivity of this reflex. The specific manner by which the higher centers influence gamma efferent activity is summarized later in this chapter.</p>
          <p o="38865" eid="1035">When a muscle contracts, the muscle spindles are shortened, which shuts down the afferent activity of these spindles. If the electrical potential of the afferent nerve activity is monitored, a silent period (no electrical activity) will be noted during this contraction stage. Gamma efferent activity can influence the length of the silent period. High gamma efferent activity makes the intrafusal fibers contract, which reduces the time the spindle is shut down during a muscle contraction. Decreased gamma efferent activity lengthens this silent period.</p>

The suddenly increased chewing force placed on the tooth instantly overloads the periodontal structures, producing a noxious stimulus. The primary afferent nerve fibers carry this information to the trigeminal spinal tract nucleus, where they synapse with interneurons. These interneurons travel to the trigeminal motor nucleus.

The nociceptive reflex protects the teeth and supportive structures from potential damage due to sudden and unusually heavy functional forces. The Golgi tendon organs protect the muscle from overcontraction by sending inhibiting stimuli directly to the muscle they monitor. Numerous other types of reflex actions are found in the muscles of mastication. Many are very complex and controlled by higher centers of the CNS. Reflex actions play a major role in functioning<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib3" o="42627" eid="1058"><sup o="42627" eid="1059">3</sup></a> (e.g., mastication, swallowing, gagging, coughing, speaking).</p>

        <p o="42712" eid="1062">The control of antagonistic muscles is of vital importance in reflex activity. It is of equal importance to the everyday function of the body. As in other muscle systems, each muscle that supports the head and in part controls function has an antagonist that counteracts its activity. This is the basis of the muscle balance previously described. Certain groups of muscles primarily elevate the mandible; other groups primarily depress it. For the mandible to be elevated by the temporal, medial pterygoid, or masseter muscles, the suprahyoid muscles must relax and lengthen. Likewise for the mandible to be depressed, the suprahyoids must contract while the elevators relax and lengthen.</p>
        <p o="43400" eid="1063">The neurologic controlling mechanism for these antagonistic groups is known as <i o="43479" eid="1064">reciprocal innervation</i>. This phenomenon enables smooth and exact control of mandibular movement to be achieved. For the skeletal relationship of the skull, mandible, and neck to be maintained, each of the antagonistic muscle groups must remain in a constant state of mild tonus. This overcomes the skeletal imbalances of gravity and keeps the head in what is termed the <i o="43849" eid="1065">postural position</i>. As previously discussed, muscle tonus plays an important role in the mandibular postural position as well as in resistance to any passive displacement of the mandible. Muscles that are in full contraction activate most of the muscle fibers that can compromise blood flow, resulting in fatigue and pain. By contrast, muscle tonus requires contraction of a minimal number of muscle fibers, and the contracting fibers are constantly rotated. This type of activity allows proper blood flow and does not produce fatigue.</p>

      <div class="level" o="44383" eid="1066">
        <h2 class="title" o="44383" eid="1067">Regulation of muscle activity</h2>
        <p o="44412" eid="1068">To create a precise mandibular movement, input from the various sensory receptors must be received by the CNS through the afferent fibers. The brainstem and cortex must assimilate and organize this input and elicit appropriate motor activities through the efferent nerve fibers. These motor activities involve the contraction of some muscle groups and the inhibition of others. It is generally thought that the gamma efferent system is permanently activated,  although it does not necessarily set up movement. The gamma discharge keeps the alpha motor neurons reflexively prepared to receive impulses arising from the cortex or directly from the afferent impulses of the spindles. Most mandibular movements are probably controlled by a link between the gamma efferents, the spindle afferents, and the alpha motor neurons. This combined output produces the required contraction or inhibition of the muscles and allows the neuromuscular system to keep a check on itself.</p>
        <p o="45380" eid="1069">Various conditions of the masticatory system greatly influence mandibular movement and function. The sensory receptors in the periodontal ligaments, periosteum, TMJs, tongue, and other soft tissues of the mouth continuously feed back information, which is processed and used to direct muscle activity. Noxious stimuli are reflexively avoided so that movement and function can occur with minimal injury to the tissues and structures of the masticatory system.</p>

        <h2 class="title" o="45838" eid="1071">Influence from the higher centers</h2>
        <p o="45871" eid="1072">As previously mentioned, the brainstem and cortex function together to assess and evaluate incoming impulses. Although the cortex is the main determinant of action, the brainstem is in charge of maintaining homeostasis and controlling normally subconscious body functions. Within the brainstem is a pool of neurons that control rhythmic muscle activities such as breathing, walking, and chewing. This pool is collectively known as the <i o="46306" eid="1073">central pattern generator</i> (CPG).<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib13" o="46338" eid="1074"><sup o="46338" eid="1075">13</sup></a>-<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib17" o="46341" eid="1076"><sup o="46341" eid="1077">17</sup></a> It is responsible for the precise timing of activity between antagonistic muscles so that specific functions can be carried out. During the process of chewing, for example, the CPG initiates contraction of the supra- and infrahyoid muscles at the precise time the elevator muscles are told to relax. This allows the mouth to open and accept food. Next, the CPG initiates contraction of the elevator muscles while relaxing the supra- and infrahyoid muscles, producing closure of the mouth onto the food. This process is repeated until the particles of food are small enough to be swallowed easily. For the CPG to be most efficient, it must receive constant sensory input from the masticatory structures. Therefore, the tongue, lips, teeth, and periodontal ligaments are constantly feeding back information that allows the CPG to determine the most appropriate and efficient chewing stroke. Once an efficient chewing pattern that minimizes damage to any structure is found, it is learned and repeated. This learned pattern is called a <i o="47377" eid="1078">muscle engram</i><b o="47390" eid="1079">.</b> Chewing therefore can be thought of as an extremely complex reflex activity that is primarily controlled by the CPG with input from numerous sensory receptors. Like many other reflex activities, chewing is a subconscious activity yet can be brought to conscious control at any time. Breathing and walking are other CPG reflex activities that generally occur at subconscious levels but can also be brought under voluntary control at will. The process of chewing is discussed in more detail later in this chapter.</p>

          <p o="47957" eid="1082">Generally, when a stimulus is sent in to the CNS, a very complex interaction takes place to determine the appropriate response. The cortex—with influence from the thalamus, CPG, limbic structures, reticular formation, and hypothalamus—determines the action that will be taken in terms of direction and intensity. This action is often almost automatic, as in chewing. Although the individual is aware of it, there is no active participation in its execution. In the absence of any significant emotional state, the action is usually predictable and accomplishes the task efficiently. However, when the individual is experiencing higher levels of emotion, such as fear, anxiety, frustration, or anger, the following major modifications of muscle activity can occur:</p><ul o="48719" eid="1083"><li o="48719" eid="1084"><span class="label" o="48719" eid="1085">1.</span><span class="item" o="48721" eid="1086">An increase in emotional stress excites the limbic structures and hypothalamic/pituitary/adrenal axis (HPA), activating the gamma efferent system.<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib18" o="48867" eid="1087"><sup o="48867" eid="1088">18</sup></a><sup o="48869" eid="1089">,</sup><a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib19" o="48870" eid="1090"><sup o="48870" eid="1091">19</sup></a> With this increased gamma efferent activity comes contraction of the intrafusal fibers, resulting in partial stretching of the sensory regions of the muscle spindles. When these spindles are partially stretched, less stretching of the overall muscle is needed to elicit a reflex action. This affects the myotatic reflex and ultimately results in an increase in muscle tonus.<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib20" o="49247" eid="1092"><sup o="49247" eid="1093">20</sup></a> The muscles also become more sensitive to external stimuli, which often leads to further increases in muscle tonicity.

    <p o="50090" eid="1102">The neuroanatomy and physiology discussed above comprise a mechanism by which important functional movements of the mandible can be executed. The masticatory system has three major functions: (1) mastication, (2) swallowing, and (3) speech. There are also secondary functions that aid in respiration and the expression of emotions. All functional movements are highly coordinated complex neuromuscular events. Sensory input from the structures of the masticatory system (i.e., teeth, periodontal ligaments, lips, tongue, cheeks, palate) is received and integrated in the CPG with existing reflex actions and learned muscle engrams to achieve a desired function. Since occlusion of the teeth plays a principal role in the masticatory system's function, a sound understanding of the dynamics of these major functional activities is essential.</p>
    <div class="level" o="50930" eid="1103">

When the stomach is full, feedback inhibits these positive feelings.</p>

        <h2 class="title" o="51804" eid="1115">The chewing stroke</h2>
        <p o="51822" eid="1116">Mastication is made up of rhythmic and well-controlled separation and closure of the maxillary and mandibular teeth. This activity is under the control of the CPG, located in the brainstem. Each opening and closing movement of the mandible represents a chewing stroke. The complete chewing stroke has a movement pattern described as tear-shaped. It can be divided into an opening phase and a closing phase. The closing movement has been further subdivided into the <i o="52287" eid="1117">crushing phase</i> and the <i o="52310" eid="1118">grinding phase</i> (<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_f0045" o="52326" eid="1119">Figure 2-8</a>). During mastication, similar chewing strokes are repeated over and over as the food is broken down. When the mandible is traced in the frontal plane during a single chewing stroke, the following sequence occurs: in the opening phase it </p><div class="figure" o="52574" eid="1120"><h2 class="title" o="52574" eid="1121"><span class="label" o="52574" eid="1122">FIGURE 2-8 </span>Frontal view of the chewing stroke.</h2><img "400" "360" class="graphic" id="978-0-323-08220-4_0039" src="./Chapter_2/978-0-323-08220-4_0039.jpg" o="52621" eid="1123"></div> drops downward from the intercuspal position to a point where the incisal edges of the teeth are about 16 to 18 mm apart. It then moves laterally 5 to 6 mm from the midline as the closing movement begins. The first phase of closure, which traps the food between the teeth, is called the crushing phase. As the teeth approach each other, the lateral displacement is lessened so that, when the teeth are only 3 mm apart, the jaw occupies a position only 3 to 4 mm lateral to the starting position of the chewing stroke. At this point the teeth are so positioned that the buccal cusps of the mandibular teeth are almost directly under the buccal cusps of the maxillary teeth on the side to which the mandible has been shifted. As the mandible continues to close, the bolus of food is trapped between the teeth. This begins the grinding phase of the closure stroke. During the grinding phase, the mandible is guided by the occlusal surfaces of the teeth back to the intercuspal position, which causes the cuspal inclines of the teeth to pass across each other, permitting shearing and grinding of the bolus of food.<p></p>
        <p o="53733" eid="1124">If the movement of a mandibular incisor is followed in the sagittal plane during a typical chewing stroke, it will be seen that during the opening phase the mandible moves slightly anteriorly (<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_f0050" o="53926" eid="1125">Figure 2-9</a>).

If the mandible moves to the right side, the right first molar moves in a pathway similar to that of the incisor. In other words, the molar moves slightly forward during the opening phase and closes on a slightly posterior pathway, moving anteriorly during the final closure as the tooth intercuspates. The condyle on the right side also follows this pathway, closing in a slightly posterior position with a final anterior movement into intercuspation (<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_f0055" o="56614" eid="1145">Figure 2-10</a>).<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib26" o="56627" eid="1146"><sup o="56627" eid="1147">26</sup></a><sup o="56629" eid="1148">,</sup><a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib28" o="56630" eid="1149"><sup o="56630" eid="1150">28</sup></a></p>

Generally, tall cusps and deep fossae promote a predominantly vertical chewing stroke, whereas flattened or worn teeth encourage a broader chewing stroke. When the posterior teeth contact in undesirable lateral movement, the malocclusion produces an irregular and less repeatable chewing stroke<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib41" o="60961" eid="1210"><sup o="60961" eid="1211">41</sup></a> (<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_f0065" o="60965" eid="1212">Figure 2-12</a>).<p></p>

        <p o="64300" eid="1270">Mastication could not be performed without the aid of adjacent soft tissue structures. As food is introduced into the mouth, the lips guide and control intake while also sealing off the oral cavity. The lips are especially necessary when liquid is being introduced. The tongue plays a major role not only in taste but also in maneuvering the food within the oral cavity for sufficient chewing. When food is introduced, the tongue often initiates the breaking-up process by pressing it against the hard palate. The tongue then pushes the food onto the occlusal surfaces of the teeth, where it can be crushed during the chewing stroke. During the opening phase of the next chewing stroke, the tongue repositions the partially crushed food onto the teeth for further breakdown. While it is repositioning the food from the lingual side, the buccinator muscle (in the cheek) is accomplishing the same task from the buccal side. The food is thus continuously replaced on the occlusal surfaces of the teeth until the particles are small enough to be swallowed efficiently. The tongue is also effective in dividing food into portions that require more chewing and portions that are ready to be swallowed. After eating, the tongue sweeps the teeth to remove any food residue that has been trapped in the oral cavity.</p>

    <div class="level" o="65607" eid="1271">
      <h2 class="title" o="65607" eid="1272">Swallowing (Deglutition)</h2>
      <p o="65631" eid="1273">Swallowing is a series of coordinated muscular contractions that move a bolus of food from the oral cavity through the esophagus to the stomach. It consists of voluntary, involuntary, and reflex muscular activity. The decision to swallow depends on several factors: the degree of fineness of the food, the intensity of the taste extracted, and the degree of lubrication of the bolus. During swallowing the lips are closed, sealing the oral cavity. The teeth are brought up into their maximum intercuspal position, thus stabilizing the mandible.</p>
      <p o="66175" eid="1274">Stabilization of the mandible is an important part of swallowing. The mandible must be fixed so that contraction of the suprahyoid and infrahyoid muscles can control proper movement of the hyoid bone needed for swallowing. The normal adult swallow utilizing the teeth for mandibular stability has been called the <i o="66488" eid="1275">somatic swallow</i>. When teeth are not present, as in the infant, the mandible must be braced by other means. In the infantile swallow, or <i o="66624" eid="1276">visceral swallow</i>,<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib59" o="66641" eid="1277"><sup o="66641" eid="1278">59</sup></a> the mandible is braced by placing the tongue forward and between the dental arches or gum pads. This type of swallow occurs until the posterior teeth erupt.</p>
      <p o="66800" eid="1279">As the posterior teeth erupt into occlusion, the occluding teeth brace the mandible and the adult swallow is assumed. On occasion, the normal transition from infantile swallow to adult swallow does not occur. This may be due to the lack of tooth support because of poor tooth position or arch relationship. The infantile swallow may also be maintained when discomfort occurs during tooth contact because of caries or tooth sensitivity. Overretention of the infantile swallow can result in labial displacement of the anterior teeth by the powerful tongue muscle. This may present clinically as an anterior open bite (no anterior tooth contacts). It should be noted, however, that the presence of a tongue-thrusting condition does not necessarily lead to altered tooth position.</p>
      <p o="67576" eid="1280">In the normal adult swallow, the mandible is stabilized by tooth contacts. The average tooth contact<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib41" o="67676" eid="1281"><sup o="67676" eid="1282">41</sup></a> during swallowing lasts about 683 ms.

        <p o="68875" eid="1300">The first stage of swallowing is voluntary and begins with selective parting of the masticated food into a mass or bolus. This separation is performed mostly by the tongue. The bolus is placed on the dorsum of the tongue and pressed lightly against the hard palate. The tip of the tongue rests on the hard palate just behind the incisors. The lips are sealed and the teeth are brought together. The presence of the bolus on the mucosa of the palate initiates a reflex wave of contraction in the tongue that presses the bolus backward. As the bolus reaches the back of the tongue, it is transferred to the pharynx.</p>

        <h2 class="title" o="69488" eid="1302">Second stage</h2>
        <p o="69500" eid="1303">Once the bolus has reached the pharynx, a peristaltic wave caused by contraction of the pharyngeal constrictor muscles carries it down to the esophagus. The soft palate rises to touch the posterior pharyngeal wall, sealing off the nasal passages. The epiglottis blocks the pharyngeal airway to the trachea and keeps the food in the esophagus. During this stage of swallowing, the pharyngeal muscular activity opens the pharyngeal orifices of the eustachian tubes, which are normally closed.<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib24" o="69990" eid="1304"><sup o="69990" eid="1305">24</sup></a> It is estimated that these first two stages of swallowing together last about 1 second.</p>

        <p o="70091" eid="1308">The third stage of swallowing consists of passing the bolus through the length of the esophagus and into the stomach. Peristaltic waves take 6 to 7 s to carry the bolus through the esophagus. As the bolus approaches the cardiac sphincter, the sphincter relaxes and lets it enter the stomach. In the upper section of the esophagus, the muscles are mainly voluntary and can be used to return food to the mouth when necessary for more complete mastication. In the lower section, the muscles are entirely involuntary.</p>

      <h2 class="title" o="70891" eid="1317">Speech</h2>
      <p o="70897" eid="1318">Speech is the third major function of the masticatory system. It occurs when a volume of air is forced from the lungs by the diaphragm through the larynx and oral cavity. Controlled contraction and relaxation of the vocal cords or bands of the larynx create a sound with the desired pitch.<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib24" o="71186" eid="1319"><sup o="71186" eid="1320">24</sup></a> Once the pitch is produced, the precise form assumed by the mouth determines the resonance and exact articulation of the sound. Because speech is created by the release of air from the lungs, it occurs during the expiration stage of respiration. Inspiration of air is relatively quick and taken at the end of a sentence or pause. Expiration is prolonged, allowing a series of syllables, words, or phrases to be uttered.</p>
      <div class="level" o="71608" eid="1321">
        <h2 class="title" o="71608" eid="1322">Articulation of sound</h2>
        <p o="71629" eid="1323">By varying the relationships of the lips and tongue to the palate and teeth, one can produce a variety of sounds.<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib24" o="71742" eid="1324"><sup o="71742" eid="1325">24</sup></a> Important sounds formed by the lips are the letters “M,” “B,” and “P.” In making these sounds, the lips come together and touch. The teeth are important in saying the “S” sound. The incisal edges of the maxillary and mandibular incisors closely approximate but do not touch. The air is passed between the teeth, and the “S” sound is created. The tongue and the palate are especially important in forming the “D” sound. The tip of the tongue reaches up to touch the palate directly behind the incisors.</p>
        <p o="72246" eid="1326">Many sounds can also be formed by using a combination of these anatomic structures. For example, the tongue touches the maxillary incisors to form the “Th” sound. The lower lip touches the incisal edges of the maxillary teeth to form the “F” and “V” sounds. For sounds like “K” or “G,” the posterior portion of the tongue rises to touch the soft palate (<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_f0075" o="72600" eid="1327">Figure 2-14</a>).</p>
        <p o="72613" eid="1328">During the early stages of life we are taught proper articulation of sounds for speech. Tooth contacts do not occur during speech. If a malpositioned tooth contacts an opposing tooth during speech, sensory input from the tooth and periodontal ligament quickly relays the information to the CNS. The CNS perceives this as potentially damaging and immediately alters the speech pattern by way of the efferent nerve pathways. A new speech pattern that avoids the tooth contact is developed. This new pattern may result in a slight lateral deviation of the mandible to produce the desired sound without tooth contact.</p>
        <p o="73226" eid="1329">Once speech is learned, it comes almost entirely under the unconscious control of the neuromuscular system. In that sense it can be thought of as a learned reflex.</p>

    <h2 class="title" o="73389" eid="1331">Considerations of Orofacial Pain</h2>
    <p o="73421" eid="1332">Pain is one of the most powerful negative emotions humans experience. It demands attention and response. Acute pain alerts the individual to the injury, allowing him or her to address the threat. Acute pain provides protection from environment challenges (the nociceptive reflex). It is basic to survival and therefore has purpose. However, some pains last far longer than normal healing time and therefore no longer have protective value. These pains are termed <i o="73884" eid="1333">chronic</i>. They can become destructive to the human spirit, leading to a significant reduction in the quality of life. Some of the most common types of chronic pain originate from musculoskeletal structures. Chronic back and neck pain is very frequent in the general population. The 12-month prevalence of neck pain ranges between 30% and 50%.<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib67" o="74225" eid="1334"><sup o="74225" eid="1335">67</sup></a> In one study,<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib68" o="74241" eid="1336"><sup o="74241" eid="1337">68</sup></a> 33% of 30- to 64-year-old workers reported having musculoskeletal pain within the preceding month and 20% of them reported multiple sites of pain. These pains are typically dull achy pains that can significantly decrease the individual's ability to function. This loss of function further compromises the quality of the individual's life. It is estimated that 10% of the general population over the age of 18 have temporomandibular disorder pain.<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib69" o="74690" eid="1338"><sup o="74690" eid="1339">69</sup></a> The prevalence of orofacial pain in the general population at age 30 to 31 years has been reported to be 23%.<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib70" o="74802" eid="1340"><sup o="74802" eid="1341">70</sup></a> In another study,<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib71" o="74822" eid="1342"><sup o="74822" eid="1343">71</sup></a> 23% to 24% of 45-year-olds in the general population reported pain during chewing.</p>

In the United States, back pain in workers 40 to 65 years of age costs employers an estimated $7.4 billion each year,<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib72" o="75123" eid="1345"><sup o="75123" eid="1346">72</sup></a> and neck pain limited work activity by between 1.7% and 11.5%.<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib67" o="75188" eid="1347"><sup o="75188" eid="1348">67</sup></a> When the emotional and economic impact of chronic pain is assessed, it is obvious that the health care provider has an important role in helping to alleviate it. The unfortunate truth, however, is that most health care providers are trained to manage acute pain and not the chronic variety. As health care providers, we must take on the responsibility of caring for the patient experiencing chronic pain.</p>
    <p o="75595" eid="1349">Certainly chronic pain in the limbs and back greatly affects the quality of life, yet for the patient experiencing chronic orofacial pain, additional emotional elements become important considerations. It is interesting to note that approximately 45% of the human sensory cortex is dedicated to the face, mouth, and oral structures (<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_f0080" o="75928" eid="1350">Figure 2-15</a>). This degree of sensory dedication suggests that these structures have significant meaning to the individual. In fact, pain felt in these structures has intense meaning </p><div class="figure" o="76110" eid="1351"><h2 class="title" o="76110" eid="1352"><span class="label" o="76110" eid="1353">FIGURE 2-14 </span>Articulation of sounds created by specific positions of the lips, tongue, and teeth.</h2><img "380" "400" class="graphic" id="978-0-323-08220-4_0045" src="./Chapter_2/978-0-323-08220-4_0045.jpg" o="76207" eid="1354"><div class="caption" o="76207" eid="1355">(Adapted from Jenkins GN. <i o="76233" eid="1356">The Physiology of the Mouth</i>. 4th ed.

For example, pain in the orofacial structures significantly limits the ability to chew, which is of course essential for survival. Although today it is possible to sustain life without chewing (i.e., with liquid diets, stomach tubes, and intravenous feeding), we know instinctively that the inability to feed threatens one's existence. Therefore chronic pain in the face threatens one's very survival. Also, pain in the orofacial structures compromises the ability to speak, which is essential in a society dependent upon communication. Chronic orofacial pain jeopardizes the individual's ability to successful engage in society both at work and play. A third aspect of chronic orofacial pain that often goes unrecognized by the clinician is the emotional component. The orofacial structures are very important to the individual for the expression of emotion. The smiles and frowns, and the laughter and tears are all expressed by our faces. Intimate activities such as kissing are also compromised by facial pain. Most clinicians are quite oblivious to this very significant and personal component of orofacial pain. Therefore clinicians need to appreciate that pain felt in the orofacial structures is much more threatening, meaningful, and personal than pain felt in other areas of the body. Often dentists who do not appreciate this relationship will move abruptly into patient examination and management without appreciating the emotional impact of the pain. Dentists must understand and appreciate that these psychological factors accompany orofacial pain, especially as the pain becomes more chronic.<p></p>

      <h2 class="title" o="77955" eid="1358">Pain Modulation</h2>
      <p o="77970" eid="1359">For many years it was believed that the degree and number of nociceptors stimulated were responsible for the intensity of pain perceived by the CNS. This, however, is not found to be true clinically. In some patients small injuries cause great pain, whereas in others only mild pain is reported with much greater injury. As pain has been studied, it has become increasingly clear that the degree of pain and suffering does not correlate well with the amount of tissue damage. Instead, the degree of pain relates more closely to the patient's <i o="78512" eid="1360">perceived threat</i> of the injury and the amount of <i o="78561" eid="1361">attention given</i> to the injury.<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib73" o="78591" eid="1362"><sup o="78591" eid="1363">73</sup></a><sup o="78593" eid="1364">,</sup><a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib74" o="78594" eid="1365"><sup o="78594" eid="1366">74</sup></a></p>
      <p o="78596" eid="1367">When this phenomenon was first appreciated, it defied the prevailing pain theories. In 1965 the gate-control theory of pain modulation<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib75" o="78730" eid="1368"><sup o="78730" eid="1369">75</sup></a> was developed to explain this phenomenon, and in 1978 this theory was modified.<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib76" o="78812" eid="1370"><sup o="78812" eid="1371">76</sup></a> Pain modulation means that the impulses arising from a noxious stimulus, which are primarily carried by the afferent neurons from the nociceptors, can be altered before they reach the cortex for recognition. This alteration or modulation of sensory input can occur as the primary neuron synapses with the interneuron when it initially enters the CNS or as the input ascends to the complex brainstem and cortex. This influence may have an excitatory effect, which increases the noxious stimulus, or an inhibitory effect, which decreases the stimulus.</p>
      <p o="79364" eid="1372">The conditions that influence the modulation of noxious input can be either psychological or physical. Psychological factors relate to the individual's emotional state (e.g., happy, sad, contented, depressed, anxious). In addition, prior conditioning influences his or her response to a noxious stimulus. Physical factors (e.g., rested or fatigued) also affect pain modulation. Tissue inflammation and hyperemia tend to enhance the sensation of pain. Likewise, the duration of the stimulus tends to affect pain </p><div class="figure" o="79875" eid="1373"><h2 class="title" o="79875" eid="1374"><span class="label" o="79875" eid="1375">FIGURE 2-15 </span>The homunculus is a graphic depiction of the functional areas of the sensory cortex.

In other words, the longer a stimulus is felt, the greater the pain becomes.<p></p>
      <p o="80169" eid="1377">It is important at this point to distinguish the differences between four terms: <i o="80250" eid="1378">nociception, pain, suffering,</i> and <i o="80284" eid="1379">pain behavior</i>. <i o="80299" eid="1380">Nociception</i> refers to the noxious stimulus originating from the sensory receptor. This information is carried into the CNS by the primary neuron. It is not pain but merely noxious information entering the CNS.</p>
      <p o="80508" eid="1381"><i o="80508" eid="1382">Pain</i> is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as “an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage.”<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib77" o="80718" eid="1383"><sup o="80718" eid="1384">77</sup></a> This definition includes far more than a simple sensation caused by tissue injury. Pain has both a sensory and emotional component. It may result from actual tissue injury, but tissue injury is not essential. The thought that pain can be felt in the absence of any tissue damage is foreign to many clinicians; however, this phenomenon illustrates the complexity of pain. As previously mentioned, the CNS has the ability to alter or modulate nociceptive input before it reaches the cortex for recognition. Therefore nociceptive input from tissue injury entering the CNS may be modified in such a manner that it never reaches the sensory cortex and therefore does not result in pain. This ability of the CNS to modulate noxious stimulation is an extremely important function. As discussed further on, the modulation of nociception input can either increase or decrease the perception of pain.</p>
      <p o="81611" eid="1385">The term <i o="81620" eid="1386">suffering</i> refers to yet another phenomenon. It refers to the way in which the individual reacts to the perception of pain. When pain is perceived by the cortex, a very complex interaction of many factors begins. Factors such as past experiences, expectations, perceived threat of the injury, and attention drawn to the injury determine to what degree the subject will suffer. Suffering, therefore, may not be proportionally related to nociception or pain. Patients experiencing little pain may suffer greatly while others with significant pain may suffer less.</p>
      <p o="82180" eid="1387"><i o="82180" eid="1388">Pain behavior</i> is still another term with a different meaning. It refers to the individual's audible and visible actions that communicate his or her suffering to others. Pain behavior is the only communication the clinician receives regarding the pain experience. This behavior is as individual as people themselves.</p>
      <p o="82495" eid="1389">The clinician must recognize that the information related to the therapist by the patient is not nociception or pain or even suffering. The patient relates only his or her pain behavior. Yet it is through this communication that the clinician must gain insight into the patient's problem. One can easily see how difficult the clinician's task is in attempting to manage pain disorders.</p>
      <p o="82880" eid="1390">As it is known today, the body has at least three mechanisms by which pain can be modulated<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib78" o="82971" eid="1391"><sup o="82971" eid="1392">78</sup></a>: (1) the nonpainful cutaneous stimulation system, (2) the intermittent painful stimulation system, and (3) the psychological modulating system.</p>
      <div class="level" o="83117" eid="1393">
        <h2 class="title" o="83117" eid="1394">Nonpainful cutaneous stimulation system</h2>
        <p o="83156" eid="1395">Nerve fibers carrying information to the CNS (afferent fibers) have various thicknesses. As mentioned earlier, the larger the diameter of the fiber, the faster the impulses it carries will travel. The afferents are divided into four major groups according to size: I (a and b), II, III, and IV. Another system utilizes standard capital letters with Greek letter subdivisions: A-alpha, equivalent to group I; A-beta, to group II; A-delta, to group III; and C, to group IV. The A-delta and C divisions are the main conductors of pain. The large A fibers (group I) carry the sensations of touch, motion, and position (proprioception). It has been postulated that if the larger fibers are stimulated at the same time as the smaller ones, the larger fibers will have precedence and mask the input to the CNS from the smaller ones.<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib76" o="83981" eid="1396"><sup o="83981" eid="1397">76</sup></a> This was initially described as the <i o="84020" eid="1398">gate control theory</i>.<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib79" o="84040" eid="1399"><sup o="84040" eid="1400">79</sup></a> According to this theory, for the effect to be great, the stimulation of the large fibers must be constant and below a painful level. The effect is immediate and usually vanishes after the large-fiber stimulus is removed.</p>
        <p o="84264" eid="1401">A clinical example of the gate control theory occurs when an individual accidentally hits his or her finger with a hammer. The pain quickly elicits a response from the individual to rub or shake the injured finger. This rubbing or shaking excites proprioceptors and mechanoreceptors, which in turn gate out the c-fiber activity carrying the noxious input. The result is less pain.</p>
        <p o="84644" eid="1402">Noxious input that reaches the spinal cord can also be altered at virtually every synapse in the ascending pathway to the cortex. This modulation of pain is attributed to various structures that have been collectively called the <i o="84873" eid="1403">descending inhibitory system</i>. The descending inhibitory system maintains an extremely important function in the CNS. It is now appreciated that the CNS receives a constant barrage of sensory impulses from all structures in the body. This sensory input is generated in the dorsal root ganglia and can be perceived as painful.<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib80" o="85197" eid="1404"><sup o="85197" eid="1405">80</sup></a> One of the roles of the descending inhibitory system is to modulate this input so as not to be perceived by the cortex as pain. This system can be thought of as an intrinsic analgesic mechanism. It appears that the descending inhibitory system utilizes several neurotransmitters, with one of the most important being serotonin.<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib81" o="85527" eid="1406"><sup o="85527" eid="1407">81</sup></a>-<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib83" o="85530" eid="1408"><sup o="85530" eid="1409">83</sup></a> This system is also likely to play an important role in the other previously discussed brainstem functions.</p>
        <p o="85640" eid="1410">The descending inhibitory system assists the brainstem in actively suppressing input to the cortex. The importance of this function becomes obvious when one looks at the process of sleep. In order for an individual to sleep, the brainstem and descending inhibitory system must completely inhibit sensory input (i.e., sound, sight, touch, taste, smell) to the cortex. Without a well-functioning descending inhibitory system, sleep would be impossible. A poorly functioning descending inhibitory system is also likely to allow unwanted sensory input to ascend to the cortex and be perceived as painful. In this condition pain is perceived in the absence of noxious stimulation. This is precisely what is seen routinely in chronic pain management centers. In other words, patients report significant pain in the absence of apparent cause.</p>
        <p o="86475" eid="1411">Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is an example of the nonpainful cutaneous stimulation system masking a painful sensation. Constant subthreshold impulses in larger nerves near the site of an injury or other lesion block the input from smaller nerves, preventing painful stimuli from reaching the brain. When the TENS is discontinued, however, the pain usually returns. (The use of TENS in the management of certain pain conditions is discussed in <a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B9780323082204000110_c0011" o="86940" eid="1412">Chapter 11</a>.)</p>

        <h2 class="title" o="86952" eid="1414">Intermittent painful stimulation system</h2>
        <p o="86991" eid="1415">Another type of pain-modulation system can be evoked by the stimulation of areas of the body that have high concentrations of nociceptors and low electrical impedance. Stimulation of these areas may reduce pain felt at a distant site. This reduction is due to the release of endogenous opioids called <i o="87292" eid="1416">endorphins</i>. Endorphins are polypeptides produced in the body that seem to have effects as powerful as (possibly more powerful than) those of morphine in reducing pain.</p>
        <p o="87459" eid="1417">Two basic types of endorphins have been identified: the enkephalins and the beta-endorphins. The enkephalins appear to be released in the cerebrospinal fluid and therefore act quickly and locally to reduce pain. The beta-endorphins are released into the bloodstream like hormones by the hypophysis cerebri. They are slower-acting than the enkephalins, but their effect lasts longer.</p>
        <p o="87841" eid="1418">For endorphins to be released, it appears that certain areas of the body must be intermittently stimulated to a level of pain. This is the basis of acupuncture: a needle placed in a specific area of the body having high concentrations of nociceptors and low electrical impedance is twisted approximately two times a second to create intermittent low levels of pain. This stimulation causes the release of certain enkephalins in the cerebrospinal fluid, which reduces the pain felt in tissues innervated by that area. Beta-endorphins are released into the bloodstream by physical exercise, especially prolonged exercise, which may help explain why long-distance runners often experience a euphoric feeling after a run (“runner's high”). Since they are released into the bloodstream, beta-endorphins create an effect that is more generalized throughout the body and lasts longer than the effect of the enkephalins.</p>

        <h2 class="title" o="88753" eid="1420">Psychological modulating system</h2>
        <p o="88784" eid="1421">At present the precise manner by which the psychological modulating system functions is not well understood. However, it is believed to exert great influence on the suffering that a person experiences. For example, certain psychological states affect pain; some positively and some negatively. Increased levels of emotional stress can be strongly correlated with increased levels of pain.<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib84" o="89172" eid="1422"><sup o="89172" eid="1423">84</sup></a> Other conditions that seem to intensify the pain experience are anxiety, fear, depression, despair, and uncertainty. As mentioned earlier, the amount of attention drawn to an injury as well as the consequence of the injury can greatly influence suffering. Patients who devote a great amount of attention to their pain are likely to suffer more. Conversely, patients who are able to direct attention away from their pain are likely to suffer less. Distractions such as psychological or physical activities can often be very helpful in reducing pain. Psychological states such as confidence, assurance, tranquility, and serenity should be encouraged. Prior conditioning and experience also affect the degree of pain felt. (The psychological modulating system is discussed in later chapters.)</p>

        <h2 class="title" o="89964" eid="1425">Rationale</h2>
        <p o="89973" eid="1426">After the concept of pain modulation has been grasped, pain can easily be seen as a great deal more than a mere sensation or reflex. It is the end result of a process that has been altered between its origins (the nociceptors) and its destination (the cortex) by both physical and psychological factors. It may best be described as an experience rather than just a sensation, especially when it is of long duration. An understanding of the experience of pain and eventually suffering may be the most important consideration in caring for patients.</p>

    <h2 class="title" o="90520" eid="1428">Types of Pain</h2>
    <p o="90533" eid="1429">To better understand and treat pain, the clinician must be able to differentiate its <i o="90618" eid="1430">source</i> from its <i o="90634" eid="1431">site</i>. Although these words may sound similar, they are not the same. The site of pain is the location where the patient describes feeling the pain. The source of pain is the location from which it actually originates. Practitioners may be tempted to assume that these are identical, but they are not always. When a patient describes a pain whose site and source are in the same location, is it is referred to as a <i o="91048" eid="1432">primary pain</i>. Primary pain is easily appreciated since it is the most common type of pain. A good example would be a toothache. The patient feels pain in a specific tooth, and a dental examination reveals this tooth to have a large carious lesion, which in fact is causing the pain. (The site and the source are the same.)</p>
    <p o="91370" eid="1433">Not all pains are primary, however, and this can make the treatment of masticatory disorders much more difficult. Some pains have their site and source in different locations. In other words, where the patient feels the pain is not where the pain is coming from. These are called <i o="91650" eid="1434">heterotopic pains</i>. There are generally three types of heterotopic pains. The first is <i o="91736" eid="1435">central pain</i>. When a tumor or other disturbance is present in the CNS, the pain is often felt not in the CNS but in peripheral structures. For example, some brain tumors can produce pain in the face, neck, and even the shoulder; often accompanying this pain are systemic symptoms of nausea, muscle weakness, numbness, and balance disorders. The initiating cause is the brain tumor but the symptoms are felt outside the CNS.</p>
    <p o="92159" eid="1436">A second type of heterotopic pain is <i o="92196" eid="1437">projected pain</i>. In this type, neurologic disturbances cause painful sensations to shoot down the peripheral distributions of the same nerve root that is involved in the disturbance. An example of projected pain would be entrapment of a nerve in the cervical region, which produces pain that is felt radiating down the arm to the hand and fingers. The site of the pain is the hand and fingers but the source is in the cervical region.</p>
    <p o="92629" eid="1438">A third type of heterotopic pain is <i o="92665" eid="1439">referred pain</i>. With this type, the sensations are felt not in the involved nerve but in other branches of that nerve or even in an entirely different nerve. An example of referred pain is cardiac pain. When a patient suffers a myocardial infarction (heart attack), the pain is often felt in the neck and mandible, radiating down the left arm, rather than in the area of the heart.<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib85" o="93045" eid="1440"><sup o="93045" eid="1441">85</sup></a><sup o="93047" eid="1442">,</sup><a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib86" o="93048" eid="1443"><sup o="93048" eid="1444">86</sup></a></p>
    <p o="93050" eid="1445">Referred pain is not a haphazard occurrence but usually follows certain clinical rules. (1) The most frequent occurrence of referred pain is within a single nerve root, passing from one branch to another (e.g., a mandibular molar referring pain to a maxillary molar). In this case, the mandibular branch of the fifth cranial nerve (trigeminal) is referring pain to the maxillary branch of the same nerve. This is a fairly common occurrence with dental pain. Generally, if the pain is referred to another distribution of the same nerve, it does so in a “laminated” manner.<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib87" o="93621" eid="1446"><sup o="93621" eid="1447">87</sup></a> This means that incisors refer to incisors, premolars to premolars, and molars to molars on the same side of the mouth. In other words, molars do not refer pain to incisors or incisors to molars. (2) Sometimes referred pain can be felt outside the nerve responsible for it. When this occurs, it generally moves cephalad (upward, toward the head) and not caudal. (3) In the trigeminal area, referred pain rarely crosses the midline unless it originates at the midline. For example, pain in the right TMJ will not cross over to the left side of the face. This is not true, however, in the cervical region or below; cervicospinal pain can be referred across the midline, although it normally stays on the same side as the source. Even cardiac pain has been shown to cross from the left to the right side of the jaw.<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib86" o="94436" eid="1448"><sup o="94436" eid="1449">86</sup></a></p>
    <p o="94438" eid="1450">Heterotopic pain is a frequent finding in head and neck pain problems and must be identified for the clinician to be successful. A basic concept is that in order for treatment to be effective, it must be directed to the source and not the site of the pain. In dealing with primary pain, the clinician should not find this a problem because the site and the source are the same. With heterotopic pain, however, a common mistake is to treat the site of the pain, and this will always fail to resolve the pain problem. An example of such a misdirected effort would be treating jaw pain at the dental level for a patient who was having a heart attack. That is, treatment must be aimed toward the <i o="95130" eid="1451">source</i> and not the site of pain.</p>
    <p o="95162" eid="1452">Another rule to remember is that local provocation of the source of pain will cause an increase in symptoms, but local provocation of the site of pain will generally not increase symptoms. For example, if the TMJ is the source of pain, jaw movement (local provocation) will accentuate the pain, but if the cervical muscles are the source and the pain is referred to the region of the TMJ (a common situation), the patient will complain of TMJ pain but jaw function will not increase this pain. The same is true when cardiac pain is referred to the jaw. Jaw function does not increase the pain. Pain that is felt in the masticatory structures, but is not accentuated by jaw function should be looked on with suspicion. It may be coming from another structure, and treatment rendered to the masticatory apparatus would not be successful.</p>

  <div class="level" o="95997" eid="1453">
    <h2 class="title" o="95997" eid="1454">The Central Excitatory Effect</h2>
    <p o="96026" eid="1455">Although referred pain has been clinically recognized for years, the precise mechanism by which it is created has not been well documented. It appears that certain input into the CNS, such as deep pain, can create an excitatory effect on other unassociated interneurons. This phenomenon is called a <i o="96325" eid="1456">central excitatory effect</i>. It has been suggested that neurons carrying nociceptive input into the CNS can excite other interneurons in one of two possible ways. The first explanation suggests that if the afferent input is constant and prolonged, it continuously bombards the interneuron, resulting in an accumulation of neurotransmitter substance at the synapses. If this accumulation becomes great, the neurotransmitter substance can spill over to an adjacent interneuron, causing it also to become excited. From there, the impulses go to the brain centrally, and the brain perceives nociception as being transmitted by both neurons. The original excited neuron is, of course, providing input from a true source of pain (primary pain), but the other neuron is being only centrally excited. Therefore, the pain perceived by the brain from this neuron is heterotopic pain (specifically, referred pain).</p>
    <p o="97226" eid="1457">A second explanation of the central excitatory effect is that of convergence.<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib88" o="97303" eid="1458"><sup o="97303" eid="1459">88</sup></a>-<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib90" o="97306" eid="1460"><sup o="97306" eid="1461">90</sup></a> It is well documented that many incoming neurons can synapse on a single interneuron. That single interneuron may itself be one of many neurons that converge to synapse with the next ascending interneuron. As this convergence nears the brainstem and cortex, it can become increasingly difficult for the cortex to evaluate the precise location of the input. Under normal circumstances the cortex does an excellent job of differentiating the site. However in the presence of continuous deep pain, the convergence can confuse the cortex, resulting in the perception of pain in normal structures (heterotopic pain).</p>
    <p o="97920" eid="1462">It is important to realize that all pains do not cause central excitatory effects. The type of pain that can create these heterotopic pain effects is constant (not intermittent) and has its source in deep structures (not the skin or gingiva). Examples of structures that can produce <i o="98203" eid="1463">deep pain</i> are musculoskeletal, neural, vascular, and visceral structures.</p>
    <p o="98276" eid="1464">Of particular interest is the relationship of the descending tract of the trigeminal nerve to the upper dorsal roots. This relationship explains how deep pain in the cervical region can commonly be referred to the face. It is important to remember that the sensory input from the trigeminal nerve synapses in the spinal V nucleus. It is also important to appreciate that the most caudal region of the spinal tract nucleus extends inferiorly into the region where the upper cervical nerves enter the spinal cord (cervical nerves 1 through 5). Therefore neurons from the trigeminal as well as cranial nerves VII, IX, and X share in the same neuronal pool with neurons from the upper cervical spine.<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib91" o="98972" eid="1465"><sup o="98972" eid="1466">91</sup></a>-<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib93" o="98975" eid="1467"><sup o="98975" eid="1468">93</sup></a> This convergence of the trigeminal and cervical nerves is an anatomic </p><div class="figure" o="99048" eid="1469"><h2 class="title" o="99048" eid="1470"><span class="label" o="99048" eid="1471">FIGURE 2-16 </span><b o="99060" eid="1472">A,</b> Injury to the trapezius muscle results in the tissue damage.

The second area of perceived pain is felt in the TMJ area, which is only a site of pain, not a source of it. This pain is heterotopic (referred).</h2><img "288" "400" class="graphic" id="978-0-323-08220-4_0047" src="./Chapter_2/978-0-323-08220-4_0047.jpg" o="99730" eid="1474"><div class="caption" o="99730" eid="1475">(Adapted from Okeson JP. <i o="99755" eid="1476">Bell's Orofacial Pains</i>. 5th ed. Chicago: Quintessence; 1995:66.)</div></div> and physiologic explanation for referred pain from the cervical region to the trigeminal. This condition is graphically depicted in <a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_f0085" o="99952" eid="1477">Figure 2-16</a>.<p></p>
    <p o="99964" eid="1478">The cervicospinal muscles and the temporomandibular joint offer an example of the central excitatory effect. It is not uncommon for a person to experience a cervicospinal extension-flexion injury (whiplash) in a motor vehicle accident.<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib94" o="100199" eid="1479"><sup o="100199" eid="1480">94</sup></a> If, after several weeks, the condition is not resolved, it becomes a source of constant deep pain. This pain input originates at the primary neurons, which synapse with interneurons, and the messages converge in the CNS. If, at the synapse of an interneuron, an overproduction of neurotransmitter substance (or a convergence effect) occurs, a nearby interneuron can be excited. From that point on the centrally excited interneuron carries nociceptive information on to the brain. If the afferent interneuron is supplying information from the tissues of the TMJ, the brain then interprets the information as pain in the TMJ. In other words, the overall interpretation of the pain experience is that pain is felt in the cervicospinal area as well as in the region of the TMJ (see <a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_f0085" o="100980" eid="1481">Figure 2-16</a>). The cervicospinal area is the true (primary) source of the pain and the TMJ the site of referred (heterotopic) pain. Thus although it may be functioning normally, the TMJ area is painful because of this central excitatory effect. Treatment of the masticatory apparatus will not resolve the complaints, since the masticatory apparatus is only the site of the pain, not the source.</p>
    <p o="101373" eid="1482">This illustration must be well appreciated by the dentist treating patients with facial pain disorders since it occurs very frequently. Failure to recognize this condition will certainly lead to an improper diagnosis and mistreatment. The importance of this phenomenon cannot be overemphasized to the dentist treating pain. The implications of this central excitatory effect are discussed in later chapters.</p>
    <div class="level" o="101780" eid="1483">
      <h2 class="title" o="101780" eid="1484">Clinical manifestations of the central excitatory effect</h2>
      <p o="101836" eid="1485">Central excitatory effects can present several distinct clinical manifestations according to the type of interneuron affected (afferent, efferent, or autonomic).</p>
      <p o="101997" eid="1486">When <i o="102002" eid="1487">afferent</i> interneurons are involved, referred pain is often reported. Referred pain is wholly dependent on the original source of the pain. In other words, local provocation of the <i o="102182" eid="1488">site</i> of the pain does not accentuate the sensation experienced by the patient. However, local provocation of the <i o="102295" eid="1489">source</i> increases the pain both at the source and often also at the site. A local anesthetic blockade of the site does not affect the pain felt, since this is not the origin of the pain. A local anesthetic blockade of the source reduces both the source and the site of referred pain. Diagnostic blocking of the painful areas can be extremely valuable in providing information that can help to differentiate the site of pain from the source of pain. This is essential for proper treatment selection and is discussed in more detail in <a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B9780323082204000109_c0010" o="102827" eid="1490">Chapter 10</a>.</p>
      <p o="102838" eid="1491">Another type of pain sensation that can be experienced when afferent interneurons are stimulated is <i o="102938" eid="1492">secondary hyperalgesia</i>.<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib95" o="102961" eid="1493"><sup o="102961" eid="1494">95</sup></a> To understand this condition, the term must be broken down and explained. <i o="103038" eid="1495">Hyper</i> implies “raised” or “increased.” <i o="103077" eid="1496">Algesia</i> suggests a painful condition. The word, in fact, means increased sensitivity to painful stimulus. When the stimulus which is not normally painful, such as light touch, produces pain the condition is known as <i o="103293" eid="1497">allodynia</i>. Primary hyperalgesia/allodynia occurs when increased sensitivity results because of some local factor, such as a splinter in the finger. After a few hours the tissue around the splinter becomes quite sensitive to touch. This is primary hyperalgesia/allodynia, because the source of the problem (the splinter) is in the same location as the site of the heightened sensitivity. Secondary hyperalgesia/allodynia is present when there is increased sensitivity of tissues without a local cause. A common location for secondary hyperalgesia/allodynia is the scalp. Patients who experience constant deep pain will commonly report that their “hair hurts.” When the scalp is examined, no local cause can be found. This is a fairly frequent occurrence in cases of head and neck pain.</p>
      <p o="104077" eid="1498">Secondary hyperalgesia and allodynia are slightly different from referred pain in that local anesthetic blocking at the source of the pain may not immediately arrest the symptoms. Instead, secondary hyperalgesia and allodynia may linger for some time (12 to 24 hours) after the blockade is administered. This clinical feature can cause some confusion during diagnosis.</p>
      <p o="104445" eid="1499">Until now we have considered only the central excitatory effect as a producer of pain symptoms. This is true when afferent interneurons are involved. If the central excitatory effect involves efferent interneurons, however, motor responses can be experienced. A common efferent effect secondary to constant deep pain is a reflex excitation of the muscle that slightly modifies its functional activity.<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib96" o="104846" eid="1500"><sup o="104846" eid="1501">96</sup></a> As previously discussed, the CPG regulates rhythmic activities of the mandible. Therefore when the mouth is opened, the depressing muscles are activated while the elevator muscles are relaxed. In the presence of pain, however, the CNS seems to respond differently. Stohler<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib97" o="105121" eid="1502"><sup o="105121" eid="1503">97</sup></a> has demonstrated that when facial pain is experimentally introduced in normal subjects, the masseter muscle reveals an increase in EMG activity during opening of the mouth. This antagonistic muscle action causes a decrease in the velocity and degree of mouth opening. It is felt that the CNS produces these effects so as to protect the threatened part.<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib8" o="105476" eid="1504"><sup o="105476" eid="1505">8</sup></a></p>
      <p o="105477" eid="1506">This phenomenon is called <i o="105503" eid="1507">protective co-contraction,</i> since there is simultaneous contraction of antagonistic muscle groups. Bell<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib98" o="105605" eid="1508"><sup o="105605" eid="1509">98</sup></a> recognized this CNS response as <i o="105640" eid="1510">protective muscle splinting</i>. Although this condition is a normal CNS response to deep pain, it can lead to muscle pain if it is prolonged. Protective co-contraction (muscle splinting) is normally experienced in the general location of the deep pain input or cephalad to it (following the same rules as for referred pain). Thus pain felt in the cervical spine can produce a reflex muscle response in the trigeminal area, as in the muscles of mastication.<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib99" o="106093" eid="1511"><sup o="106093" eid="1512">99</sup></a> This condition is not unusual and unfortunately fools many dentists into treating the muscles of mastication as the primary source of the pain. However, such treatment alone cannot resolve the problem since the origin of the protective co-contraction is the cervical spine. Cervicospinal pain must be addressed for effective elimination of the masticatory muscle pain.</p>
      <p o="106464" eid="1513">Another type of efferent effect produced by deep pain input is the development of a localized area of hypersensitivity within the muscle tissues. These areas are called <i o="106633" eid="1514">trigger points;</i> they are discussed in more detail in later chapters.</p>
      <p o="106701" eid="1515">An understanding of the effect of deep pain on the masticatory muscles is extremely important for patient management. This topic is discussed in greater detail in later chapters. One aspect of this pain, however, must be addressed here since it is vitally important in understanding muscle pain. As already stated, deep pain input can induce protective co-contraction. If co-contraction is protracted, muscle pain will result. Once muscle pain is present, it represents a source of deep pain, which can continue to produce more co-contraction. The clinical result is a pain condition that is self-perpetuating. This condition then becomes wholly independent of the original source of pain. Previously this condition was called cyclic muscle spasm. Recent studies, however, fail to support the concept that the muscles are actually experiencing spasms.<a href="http://online.vitalsource.com/books/978-0-323-08220-4/content/id/B978032308220400002X_bib8" o="107552" eid="1516"><sup o="107552" eid="1517">8</sup></a> Therefore this condition is more appropriately called <i o="107608" eid="1518">cyclic muscle pain</i>. This condition can become a diagnostic problem since the patient continues to report pain and suffering long after the original cause of the condition has been resolved.</p>
      <p o="107797" eid="1519">Since cyclic muscle pain is an important clinical problem, the following example is given to illustrate some considerations in its management:</p>
      <p o="107939" eid="1520">A third molar is extracted, and during the ensuing week a localized osteitis (dry socket) develops. This becomes a source of constant deep pain that, by way of the central excitatory effect, produces protective co-contraction (muscle splinting) of the masseter and medial pterygoid muscles. The patient returns in 5 days complaining of the painful condition. Examination reveals a limited range of mandibular opening secondary not only to the surgical procedure and infection but also to the muscle response associated with the pain. If the source of the deep pain is resolved quickly (i.e., the local osteitis eliminated), the protective co-contraction is resolved and normal mandibular opening will return. If the source is not quickly resolved, the protracted co-contraction may itself produce pain, which then perpetuates the protective co-contraction and establishes a cyclic muscle pain condition. In such a case, eliminating the original source of pain (the osteitis) will not eliminate the muscle pain. Treatment must now be directed specifically toward the masticatory muscle pain disorder, which has become wholly independent of the original source of pain.</p>
      <p o="109106" eid="1521">If central excitatory effects involve the autonomic neurons, characteristic manifestations will be seen. Since the autonomic system controls the dilation and constriction of blood vessels, variation in blood flow may appear as reddening or blanching of the involved tissues. Patients may complain of puffy eyelids or a dry eye. Sometimes the conjunctivae of the eye will redden. Even allergy-type symptoms may be reported (e.g., a stuffy or runny nose). Some patients may report a feeling of swelling of the face on the same side as the pain. Clinically significant swelling is rarely seen in temporomandibular disorders, yet this complaint is commonly reported by many patients and may represent very slight edema secondary to autonomic effects.</p>
      <p o="109852" eid="1522">The key to determining whether these symptoms are a result of the central excitatory effect is their unilaterality. Because central excitatory effects do not cross the midline in the trigeminal area, the clinical manifestations will normally be seen only on the side of the constant deep pain. In other words, one eye will be red and the other normal, one nostril may be discharging mucus and the other not. If the source of the autonomic problem were systemic (e.g., allergy), both eyes would be red and both nostrils discharging.</p>
      <p o="110383" eid="1523">An understanding of these central excitatory effects is basic to the management of facial pain problems. The role that such conditions play in the diagnosis and treatment of temporomandibular disorders is discussed in detail in later chapters.</p>
